## üìÑ Project Overview

This architecture simulates how a modern web browser manages browsing history, allowing multiple tabs to be open simultaneously and enabling navigation between pages within each tab. The system is designed to highlight the internal structure of a browser, including features such as opening, closing, and switching tabs, navigating forward and backward through pages, as well as maintaining per-tab browsing history.

## üèóÔ∏è Command Implementation

All supported commands are defined in `command.h` and implemented in their
corresponding source files. The command system interprets user input and
updates the browser state accordingly.

---

## üìö API Overview

### `command.h`

The `command.h` file defines the command system used to interpret and execute user-input commands. Each command is represented by a hashed value and is mapped to a specific function responsible for its execution.

- **`Command`**  

Enumeration representing hashed command names. Each value corresponds to a hash of a string (e.g., `"NEW_TAB"` becomes `2670`), making it harder to reverse engineer the actual command names.

#### Typedefs

- **`comm_t`**  
    Function pointer type for the command functions:
    ```c
    typedef void (*comm_t)(browser_t *, linked_list_t *, FILE*, FILE*);

## Function Parameters

Each function associated with a command receives the following parameters:

- **`browser_t *browser`**: A pointer to the browser instance.
- **`linked_list_t *pages`**: A linked list containing the stored pages 
- **`FILE *in`**: The input file stream (used for reading commands).
- **`FILE *out`**: The output file stream (used for printing results or error messages).

## Functions

### `comm_t command_translator(char line[256])`
- **Description**: This function receives a command line as input, computes the hash of that command, and returns a pointer to the corresponding function that will execute that command.

### `void new_tab(...)`
- **Description**: Creates a new tab in the browser. The new tab becomes the current tab, and its ID is calculated by incrementing the ID of the last tab in the list. The tab is set to the default page.

### `void close(...)`
- **Description**: Closes the current tab and updates the browser to set the tab to the left of the closed one as the current tab. Closing the tab with ID 0 (the default tab) is not allowed, and in case of an error, an appropriate error message will be displayed.

### `void open(...)`
- **Description**: Opens a tab with a specified ID. If the tab with that ID does not exist, an error message will be displayed.

### `void next(...)`
- **Description**: Moves the current tab to the next tab in the list of tabs. If there is a tab after the current one, it becomes active.

### `void prev(...)`
- **Description**: Moves the current tab to the previous tab in the list of tabs. If there is a tab before the current one, it becomes active.

### `void page(...)`
- **Description**: Opens a page with a specified ID in the current tab. If the page does not exist, an error message will be displayed. The current page is saved in the "Backward" stack, and the "Forward" stack is emptied.

### `void backward(...)`
- **Description**: Accesses the last page from the "Backward" stack for the current tab. The current page is saved in the "Forward" stack. If the "Backward" stack is empty, an error message will be displayed.

### `void forward(...)`
- **Description**: Accesses the last page from the "Forward" stack for the current tab. The current page is saved in the "Backward" stack. If the "Forward" stack is empty, an error message will be displayed.

### `void print(...)`
- **Description**: Prints the IDs of all open tabs in the browser, starting from the current tab and continuing to the right. Additionally, it prints the description of the current page for the current tab on a new line.

### `void print_history(...)`
- **Description**: Prints the browsing history for a tab with the specified ID. The history is displayed in the following order: the "Forward" stack (from first to last added), the current page, and the "Backward" stack (from last to first added). If the tab does not exist, an error message will be displayed.

### `main.c`

Acts as the entry point for the browser simulation. This file is responsible for initializing the environment, processing input commands, and managing the overall program flow.

#### Responsibilities

- Opens input and output files: `tema1.in` and `tema1.out`.
- Loads an initial set of pages using `arrayPage()`.
- Initializes the browser with the default page.
- Reads and executes a number of commands defined in the input file.
- Routes each command through `command_translator()` to resolve and execute the appropriate function.
- Manages proper memory deallocation and file cleanup.

#### Execution Flow

1. Opens input/output files with error handling.
2. Reads the number of pages (`n`) and loads them into a `linked_list_t` using `arrayPage()`.
3. Initializes a `browser_t` instance using the first page in the list.
4. Reads the number of commands (`m`) and executes them one by one:
   - Reads each command keyword.
   - Translates the keyword into a function pointer using `command_translator()`.
   - Executes the command with `browser`, `page_list`, `in`, and `out` as arguments.
5. Cleans up memory and closes file descriptors.

#### Key Functions Used

- `arrayPage(int n, FILE *in)`  
    Reads `n` pages from input and stores them in a linked list.

- `initBrowser(page_t *page)`  
    Initializes a browser instance with a given page loaded into the first tab.

- `command_translator(char line[256])`  
    Maps a string command to its respective function pointer.

- Command execution functions from `command.h`, such as:
    - `new_tab()`, `close()`, `open()`, `page()`
    - `next()`, `prev()`, `backward()`, `forward()`
    - `print()`, `print_history()`

- `freeBrowser(browser_t *browser)`  
    Frees all memory used by the browser and its associated tabs/pages.

- `freePages(linked_list_t *p)`  
    Frees memory used by the list of pages.

## üëë `mem_support.h` ‚Äî The Guardian of Memory in Critical Moments

The **`mem_support.h`** header acts as an emergency safeguard for memory management during the execution of the program. Its main function, `mem_support()`, is designed to be called **mid-execution** whenever a critical failure occurs ‚Äî such as a failed dynamic memory allocation ‚Äî to ensure the program exits cleanly without memory leaks:

- Frees the main `browser_t` structure, if it has already been allocated
- Deallocates the `linked_list_t` page list, if it exists
- Closes any open input/output files (`FILE *in`, `FILE *out`)
- Exits the program gracefully using `exit(0)`

This function provides a **controlled and safe exit strategy** for exceptional scenarios, preventing the program from continuing in an invalid or unstable state. It's a critical tool for robust and defensive programming.

> üëë ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a game over ‚Äî it‚Äôs a clean exit.‚Äù

## üîç Step-by-Step Explanation for Example Input

### `PAGE 1`  
Opens the page with ID `1` (`Stanford University`) in the current tab (`Tab 0`).  
The initial page (`Computer Science`) is saved to the **Backward** stack.

---

### `PRINT`  
Displays the current state of the browser tabs and the current page in `Tab 0`.

---

### `NEW_TAB`  
Creates a new tab (`Tab 1`) which becomes the active one.  
The new tab is initialized with the default page (`Computer Science`).

---

### `PAGE 2`  
Opens the page with ID `2` (`University of Oxford`) in `Tab 1`.  
The previous page is saved in the **Backward** stack.

---

### `PRINT`  
Prints the active tabs and the current page in `Tab 1`.

---

### `PRINT`  
Prints the state of the browser with `Tab 0` as the active tab.

---

### `CLOSE`  
Attempts to close the current tab (`Tab 0`).  
If it cannot be closed (e.g., it's the only tab or default one), an error message is shown.  
Otherwise, focus shifts to a neighboring tab.

---

### `PRINT`  
Shows the updated tab state after attempting to close `Tab 0`.

Loads the page with ID `3` (`Harvard University`) into `Tab 2`.  
The current page is pushed to the **Backward** stack.

---

### `BACKWARD`  
Navigates back to the previous page in `Tab 2` (`Computer Science`).  
`Harvard University` is pushed to the **Forward** stack.

---

### `PRINT`  
Displays the current tab list and the active page after going back.

---

### `FORWARD`  
Moves forward in the history to `Harvard University`.

---

### `PRINT`  
Prints the current page and active tab after forward navigation.

---

### `OPEN 0`  
Switches focus to the tab with ID `0` if it exists.

---

### `PRINT`  
Shows the state of the browser with `Tab 0` now active.

---

### `NEXT`  
Moves focus to the next tab (`Tab 1`).

---

### `PRINT`  
Displays the active tab (`Tab 1`) and the corresponding page.

---

### `PRINT_HISTORY 0`
